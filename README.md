# Clustering-with-FiftyOne-
This project demonstrates how to structure unstructured visual data using clustering techniques with FiftyOne and Scikit-learn. We use CLIP embeddings and UMAP for dimensionality reduction and visualize clusters with the FiftyOne App. Additionally, we label clusters using GPT-4V to enhance understanding of cluster characteristics.
